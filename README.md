Tic-tac-toe, or Xs and Os is a paper-and-pencil game for two players who take turns marking the spaces in a three-by-three grid with X or O. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner. It is a solved game, with a forced draw assuming best play from both players.

The application is built as first step of my Mobile Apps Development plan.

Taken the paper-and-pencil theme, and two modes of playing
* Single Player : You Play against very naÃ¯ve PC  
* Multi Player : Two Players play against each other on the device



## Built With


* Kotlin
* Android Studio
